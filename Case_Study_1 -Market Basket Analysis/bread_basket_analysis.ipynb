    "We aim to identify relationships between items within dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mittalvasu95/the-bread-basket/data), which originates, according to the source, from a bakery in Edinburgh. Our goal is to uncover which products are frequently purchased together, quantify the strength of these co-occurrences, and provide strategic recommendations based on our findings.\n",

    "This analysis draws inspiration from the article [*\"A Conceptual Introduction into Association Rule Mining — Part 2\"*](https://medium.com/delvify/a-conceptual-introduction-into-association-rule-mining-part-2-96c73c4ce87b) authored by Annette Catherine Paul, published on August 13, 2021. My goal is to re-create and adapt her analysis, but with my own unique approach. I am driven by a curiosity to explore the outcomes and a desire to verify the accuracy of her conclusions. I respect her methodological process and see this project as a valuable opportunity to enhance my understanding, as she has extensive experience in the field.\n",

Customers frequently pair coffee with other items, such as pastries, cakes, or light meals like toast or a Spanish brunch.

By tapping into this insight, businesses can strategically boost transaction volume and attract a wider customer base.\n",
